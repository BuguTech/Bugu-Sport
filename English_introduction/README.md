## Development Purpose
   * To provide niche sports fans with a platform to find the same fans.
   * To increase sports communication channels between schools. We provide more opportunities for students from different schools and campuses to communicate directly to expand their sports social circles and media of exchanges and cooperation.  
   * To organize annual inter-campus sports competitions and create “sports cards” for different schools. (With references to the annual Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race and the annual Harvard-Yale Football Game)
   * To improve the atmosphere and influence of campus sports activities. We explore the formation and connotation of campus sports culture so that students can experience a better sports life on campus.
   * To enhance the professionalism of campus sports. We try to bring professional resources into the campuses and explore the possibility of expanding the range of selection for professional sports. (With references to the development of campus basketball in the U.S. and campus football in Japan.)     
   * To explore the commercial value of campus sports. We learn from the experience of established student sports leagues like the NCAA.

## Expectations
   * We hope to cooperate with more schools' sports departments or associations to create a better campus sports community and provide users with better services.
   * We also hope to introduce professional resources, such as coaches and referees, to provide professional guidance for students. We hope to build up a scouting system to explore more potential players.

## Meet the Developer
   * Our team is composed of 3 programmers and one user interface designer. We are also sports lovers, focusing on the development of campus sports. We hope to contribute to the development of campus sports so that the campus sports atmosphere can be more robust. We also hope that students can have more ways to compete with partners from different campuses and schools.
   * Developing this mini-program, on the one hand, is to explore the possibilities of campus sports and find more inspiration in practice to be more likely to help the development of campus sports in the future on the other.
   * Due to our initial experience, our team size is relatively small, and Bugu-Sports still has various deficiencies and constant iteration.
   * After some exploration of on-campus sports, we found many problems and resistance. However, our desire to help the development of campus sports remains. Therefore, we sincerely hope that more and more people will pay attention to campus sports and even devote themselves to them. Together, we can create a different possibility for the development of campus sports.
